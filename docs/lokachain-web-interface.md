# 🌐 Lokachain Web Interface

This is the frontend interface for interacting with the **Lokachain** blockchain, built on the Cosmos SDK. It allows users to:

- Add a chain to Keplr
- Check their address and balance
- Send tokens
- Initialize CosmWasm client
- Run useful CLI commands

---

## 🔧 Development Notes

### 🧾 Account Setup
- Keplr generates new accounts from your seed.
- Pre-funded accounts:
  - `alice` (~20M STAKE)
  - `bob` (~100 STAKE)
- You can transfer tokens from `alice`/`bob` to your Keplr address for testing.

### 🧪 Troubleshooting
- Check browser console (`F12`) for detailed logs.
- Ensure **Keplr** is installed and unlocked.
- Verify RPC/REST endpoints are accessible.
- Ensure your blockchain is running.
- Try refreshing the page if issues persist.

### ⚙️ Gas Configuration
| Level    | Gas Value         |
|----------|-------------------|
| Low      | `0.01 STAKE/gas`  |
| Average  | `0.025 STAKE/gas` |
| High     | `0.04 STAKE/gas`  |
